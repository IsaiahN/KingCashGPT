Terayon 4 for phpBB3.0.9

Hello and thank you for taking the time to try out my phpBB3 design style. 
Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns about the theme.
 
___________________________________________________________

Theme Title: Terayon 4 (based on proSilver for phpBB 3.0.9)

Current Theme Version: 4.1.1 

Theme Designer: Lithosphere (aka Lithovation Studios)

___________________________________________________________

Theme Description: 

This new version of the Terayon style follows loosely on the colour selection from the older now retired Terayon v2 style, which used shades of blue, gray and white. However this version of the Terayon theme is completely based on the updated phpBB3 proSilver theme and compatible with the latest version of phpBB3 (v3.0.9). The new Terayon (v4) style features a streamlined simplistic GUI. Running clean straight lines and mild gradients of gray and blue.

-new layout style for the viewforum area, matched with the front page of the theme.
